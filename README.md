# CombinatoricsChromino

This a virtual version of the game Chromino. It is a generalized version of Domino, where instead of 2 sides to the tile there are 3 sides and instead of dots there are colors. You must match at least 2 sides of the tile to one on the board. Whoevre clears their hand first wins. This is game played by 2 computers, but can be easily customized for more than one computer.
